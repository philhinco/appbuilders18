# App Builders 2018 Scholarships
During the previous editions of App Builders, we offered a limited number of tickets to students at a discounted price. It turned out to be a great decision as we welcomed students from all over Europe.

We are very busy working on App Builders 2018 and we want to get students involved. We would like to inspire them in contributing to the community, learning the newest technologies and meeting new amazing people. For this reason, we are excited to announce the **App Builders 2018 Scholarships**.

### Applying
We would like to see your passion for mobile development. 
Describe one of your projects which could be already available in the App Store or Google Play, open-source project on GitHub or simply an idea that you would like to turn into a reality in the near future.
